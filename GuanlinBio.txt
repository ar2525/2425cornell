Dear Mr. Nixon,
Hello!
My name is Guanlin Chen. I am currently a graduate student in Information Science at Cornell University, focusing on Data Science. I am very excited to have the opportunity to collaborate with you and the Microsoft team!  
I come from Changchun, a city in northeastern China. I have a passion for traveling and have visited over 15 countries. I enjoy the sense of the unknown that traveling brings, as well as the satisfaction of achieving success. Additionally, I have a strong interest in music and am proficient in playing the piano and guitar.
I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, majoring in Computer Science and Data Science. I also served as the President of the Chinese Students Association. My journey with programming began in high school when I participated in VEX Robotics competitions and achieved second place in California. This experience was the catalyst for my interest in programming.
In terms of work experience, I interned at Volkswagen as a Software Engineer. I also interned at iFlytek, one of the biggest AI companies in China, working on large language models. These two experiences were immensely beneficial, not only enhancing my professional skills but also providing me with insights into industry operations. Furthermore, I worked as a Product Manager at an AI education company, which further enriched my background from another perspective.
By participating in this Microsoft project, I hope to integrate the academic knowledge I have acquired at Cornell University with Microsoftâ€™s industry practices, thereby enhancing my professional skills and hands-on experience. At the same time, I aim to improve my communication and collaboration abilities by working with a new team and expanding my network. I also hope to identify and address my own areas for improvement, whether they relate to my personality, abilities, or work methods. I will treat this project as a formal job and believe that the growth I gain from this project will far exceed my expectations.
In summary, I am a passionate, optimistic, outgoing, and growth-oriented student. I am very much looking forward to collaborating with you and the Microsoft team to achieve outstanding results together.
