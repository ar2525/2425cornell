My name is Lutian (Luti-an) Wang. I am from Chengdu, a city near the Himalayan Mountains in Western China. 
Before pursuing a graduate degree in Information Science at Cornell, I completed my undergraduate studies at USC, majoring in Public Relations and minoring in Applied Analytics. 
My education there focused primarily on various forms of writing and campaign development driven by intuitive decision-making. 
However, I noticed a growing demand for professionals in the field who could leverage both qualitative and quantitative skills to make more data-driven decisions, which motivated me to continue my education at Cornell.
I am excited to work on this project and further develop my communication, teamwork, and data analysis skills. 
I look forward to contributing my expertise while remaining eager to learn any new technical skills along the way!
