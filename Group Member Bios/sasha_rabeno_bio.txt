Hi all! I'm Sasha. I'm from New Jersey, and just wrapped up my undergrad in Pennsylvania (at Lehigh University). 
I'm really into the Pokemon video games, as well as a myriad of creative hobbies (drawing, music, and crocheting, to name a few).
For my undergrad, I was in an integrated degree program where I studied computer science, a bunch of humanities, and engineering ethics. 
This really formed my current academic/professional interests: I don't have my sights set on Big Tech, but I'd like to be doing something 
around ethical computing/preventing the harms that can be caused by large-scale computing systems. My senior project was creating a 
(basic) simulation of YouTube, to try and observe how YouTube (and other social media sites) use their recommendation algorithms to 
funnel people towards politically extreme content. Super upbeat and cheery stuff. From this project, I'm looking to get whatever 
experience I can working on a project that isn't just for a class/grade. I'm hoping it will be a reasonable amount of challenge---I know 
that I know how to code, but because my degree isn't a plain old CS degree I worry that I'm behind my peers in terms of software 
development/coding more broadly. I'm really excited to start the project, regardless, and I hope my contributions will be meaningful!
